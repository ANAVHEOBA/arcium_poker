---

### 5. `test_edge_cases.ts`
Tests for security, edge cases, and error conditions.

**Chip Conservation:**
- ✅ Total chips remain constant throughout game
- ✅ Pot + player stacks = initial total
- ✅ No chips created or destroyed

**Timeout Handling:**
- ✅ Detects player timeout
- ✅ last_action_at timestamp updated
- ✅ Timeout threshold enforced

**Integer Overflow/Underflow:**
- ✅ Handles maximum chip values
- ✅ Prevents negative chip stacks
- ✅ Safe arithmetic operations
- ✅ u64 boundary handling

**Concurrent Action Prevention:**
- ✅ Prevents two players from acting simultaneously
- ✅ Turn order strictly enforced
- ✅ Race condition prevention

**State Validation:**
- ✅ Validates game state transitions
- ✅ Player count never exceeds max
- ✅ Invalid state transitions rejected
- ✅ Stage progression validated

**Zero/Null Value Handling:**
- ✅ Rejects zero buy-in
- ✅ Rejects zero bet amounts
- ✅ Handles empty player lists
- ✅ Null pointer prevention

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- Chip conservation laws
- Timeout mechanisms
- Integer boundaries
- Concurrency control
- State machine validation
- Zero value handling

## Known Limitations

1. **Arcium MPC Integration**: Tests use placeholder MPC calls. Real MPC testing requires deployed MXE program.

2. **Token Integration**: SPL token tests not included (would require token minting setup).

3. **Performance Tests**: Load testing and stress tests not included.

4. **Network Tests**: Tests assume local validator, not testing network conditions.

---

## Future Test Additions

1. **Arcium MPC Tests**
   - Real shuffle verification
   - Card reveal validation
   - ZK proof verification

2. **Token Integration Tests**
   - SPL token escrow
   - Withdrawal mechanisms
   - Rake collection

3. **Tournament Tests**
   - Blind increases
   - Player elimination
   - Prize distribution

4. **Statistics Tests**
   - Win rate tracking
   - Hand history
   - Leaderboard

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Concurrent games
   - Maximum players
   - Transaction throughput

---

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in `tests/` directory
2. Follow existing naming convention: `test_<feature>.ts`
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Add to package.json scripts
5. Update this document

### Test Best Practices
- Each test should be independent
- Use beforeEach for setup
- Clean up after tests
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases
- Document complex scenarios

---

## Continuous Integration

Recommended CI/CD setup:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
