🎯 WHAT'S ACTUALLY MISSING
Critical (Needed for Production)
❌ Real Arcium MPC Integration - Currently uses dummy shuffles/deals
❌ Token Integration - Join/leave don't lock/release real tokens
⚠️ Side Pot Testing - Logic exists but untested with multiple all-ins
❌ Blind Posting - Currently manual, should be automatic
Important (Security)
❌ Shuffle Verification - ZKP verification stubbed
❌ Card Reveal Verification - No cryptographic checks
❌ Timeout Enforcement - Logic exists but not enforced
Nice to Have
❌ Tournament Mode - Not implemented
❌ Rake Collection - Not implemented
❌ Player Statistics - Not implemented
