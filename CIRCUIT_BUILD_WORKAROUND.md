# Encrypted-IXs Circuit Build Workaround

## Issue

The `encrypted-ixs` circuits cannot currently build due to a dependency issue:

```
error: failed to download `base64ct v1.8.0`
  feature `edition2024` is required
  The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`,
  but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo.
```

**Root Cause**: `arcis-imports@0.3.0` has a transitive dependency on `base64ct@1.8.0`, which requires Rust edition 2024 (not yet stable).

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Use Rust Nightly (Recommended)

```bash
# Update rust-toolchain.toml
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly"

# Install nightly
rustup toolchain install nightly

# Build circuits
cargo build-sbf
```

### Option 2: Wait for arcis-imports Update

The Arcium team will likely update `arcis-imports` to use a compatible version of `base64ct`.

### Option 3: Deploy Pre-Built Circuits

If you have access to a machine with nightly Rust:
1. Build circuits on that machine
2. Deploy the compiled `.so` file
3. Use the deployed program ID

## Current Status

- ✅ Circuit code is correct (`encrypted-ixs/src/lib.rs`)
- ❌ Cannot build due to dependency issue
- ✅ Can still deploy MXE by using pre-built binaries or waiting for fix

## Implications for Integration

**Good news**: The Solana program side doesn't depend on building the circuits. You can:

1. ✅ Update the Solana program integration code
2. ✅ Create client-side encryption helpers
3. ✅ Test with mock mode (no MXE accounts)
4. ⏳ Deploy MXE circuits once build issue is resolved

## Next Steps

For now, focus on:
1. Creating TypeScript encryption helpers
2. Updating CPI integration code
3. Testing with mock mode
4. Check back with Arcium Discord for dependency fix
